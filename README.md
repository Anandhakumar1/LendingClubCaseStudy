## General Information
- Loan Characteristics such as loan amount, term, purpose which shows the information about the loan that will help us in finding loan default.
- Demographic Variables such as age, employment status, relationship status which shows the information about the borrower profile which is not useful for us.
- Behavioural Variables such as next payment date, EMI, delinquency which shows the information which is updated after providing the loan which in our case is not useful as we need to decide whether we should approve the loan or not by default analysis.

## Conclusions
- After analysing all the related features available in the dataset, we have come to an end, deducing the main driving features for the Lending Club Loan Default analysis:
- The best driving features for the Loan default analysis are: term, grade, purpose, revol_util, int_rate, installment, annual_inc, funded_amnt_inv
